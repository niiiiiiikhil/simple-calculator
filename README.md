# Simple Calculator (Mobile-Friendly)

Hey! 👋 This is a **cool calculator app** I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It can:
✅ Add, subtract, multiply, divide  
✅ Handle percentages (%)  
✅ Calculate square and square root  
✅ Keep a history of past calculations (like `2 + 2 = 4`)  
✅ Switch between dark mode and light mode  
✅ Work with keyboard input (Enter, Backspace, Escape)  
✅ Let you copy the result easily  
✅ Works great on **mobile devices** and small screens!
